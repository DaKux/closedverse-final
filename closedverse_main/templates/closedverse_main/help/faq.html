        <h2>I saw a comment with a spoiler in it, even though it wasn’t marked as having spoilers.</h2>
        <p>It’s up to users to mark their posts as having spoilers. However, if someone forgets to do this, you can help by reporting spoilers.</p>
        <p>Comments and posts that receive enough spoiler reports will be marked as spoilers, viewable only to people who have chosen to keep spoilers visible.</p>
